The characters, such as \"Chen Ji,\" \"Mrs. Shun,\" \"Uncle Mao,\" \"Jue Wu Yin,\" \"Miss Su,\" \"A Wei,\" and \"Ah Kang,\" mostly hail from the grassroots, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. For example, \"Mrs. Shun,\" portrayed by Lydia Shum, later became a term to describe uneducated women who follow trends blindly. \"Chen Ji,\" played by Lawrence Ng, is a stockbroker who loves to show off his wealth, and his behavior typified that of many Hong Kongers, becoming a byword for the city's nouveau riche.",
